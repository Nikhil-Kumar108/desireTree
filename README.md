Hi, I’m Nikhil Kumar, a beginner data analyst with a passion for data analysis, data visualization, and Power BI. I’m excited to start my career as a data analyst and contribute my skills to help companies make data-driven decisions. I’m eager to learn and grow in this field and I’m confident that with my passion and dedication, I’ll be able to make a significant contribution to the data analytics community.

I have recently graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Science and I’m looking for opportunities to work as a data analyst. I have worked on several projects that have helped me develop my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and Power BI. Here are some of my recent projects:

Sales Insights Power BI Project (11/2023 - 11/2023): This project was based on a computer hardware business which was facing challenges in a dynamically changing market. I built a Power BI dashboard that can give real-time sales insights.

Cricket Data Analytics Project (12/2023): I used cricket T20 world cup (2022) data to build insights on the best 11 players team. I used Bright Data web scraping to collect data from espncricinfo website then performed some data transformation and cleaning in pandas, followed by building dashboards in Power BI.

I’m proficient in Python, SQL and have experience in analyzing small datasets and extracting meaningful insights using these tools. I’m an effective communicator and can explain complex data insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

If you’re interested in working together, please feel free to reach out to me at nikhilkeshav007@gmail.com. I’m always open to new opportunities and would love to hear from you!
